                    <p class="indent5">Yes, charge controllers are a critical part of solar installations. The only exception to needing a charge controller is if you have small panels smaller than five watts. The solar charge controller sits between the solar panels and battery bank and prevents overcharging of batteries by limiting the amount and rate of charge to your batteries. Solar charge controllers also prevent battery drainage by shutting down the system if stored power falls below 50 percent capacity. This helps preserve the life and health of the batteries.</p>

                    <p class="indent5">A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source.  A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process.</p>

                    <p class="indent5">Most automotive applications use DC. An automotive battery provides power for engine starting, lighting, and ignition system. The alternator is an AC device which uses a rectifier to produce DC for battery charging. Most highway passenger vehicles use nominally 12 V systems. Many heavy trucks, farm equipment, or earth moving equipment with Diesel engines use 24 volt systems. In some older vehicles, 6 V was used, such as in the original classic Volkswagen Beetle. At one point a 42 V electrical system was considered for automobiles, but this found little use.</p>

                    <p class="indent5">A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.</p>
